# JavaScript Objects Practice
This practice assignment worked on creating and using JavaScript Objects to store and display data. 

## Practice 1: Represent your Pet
Create an object that represents your pet.

  1. Name property with a string value.
  1. Species property with a string value.
  1. Nicknames property with an array value. Array contains strings.
  1. Age property with an integer value

## Practice 2: Accessing Property Values
Given a provided object with information about the Beatles, we were asked to output the following value to the console. 

```text
Paul McCartney was in the Beatles from 1960 to 1970. He was born in 1942. He contributed heavily to the Magical Myster Tour Album.
```

## Challenge: Political Campaign
You have volunteered your time to a local political candidate, Elizabeth Sanger, who wants to become a US representative in Congress for your district. Unfortunately, the team discovered that you're a software developer, so they have begged you to build an application that lets them track volunteers, and store information about Elizabeth and her campaign.

Your job is to define the different objects and arrays, their structure, and the corresponding properties for each, to represent the following information about Elizabeth's campaign.

  1. Her congressional district (you can use yours here)
  1. Her platform statements for the following issues.
      1. Taxes
      1. Jobs
      1. Infrastructure
      1. Health care
      1. Crime and enforcement
  1. URL for donation form
  1. Calendar of events
  1. Volunteer information
      1. Name
      1. Address
      1. Email
      1. Phone number
      1. Availability
      1. What activities each one is willing to do (e.g. answering phone calls, taking polls, etc.)
  1. Biography
  1. Image gallery
      1. Head shot
      1. Picture of family
      1. Picture of constituents
  1. Mission statement
  1. URL for registering to vote

## Advanced Challenge: Political Campaign: Part 2
After you have defined all the objects for representing the data about Elizabeth's campaign, write a corresponding function for each one whose purpose is to change the state of the object. Then use your functions to modify the existing data.
